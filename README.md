# Airline-Safety
Business Problem:
The business problem is to analyze and present a comprehensive comparison between airline safety and car safety, focusing on the significantly lower number of fatalities in the airline industry. This analysis aims to provide insights into the safety performance of different modes of travel and raise awareness among stakeholders.

Background/History:
This section provides context on the importance of safety in transportation and highlights the public's perception of airline safety compared to other forms of transportation. It briefly shows historical incidents that have shaped the perception of safety in both industries.

Data Explanation:
There are two files, one contains data on airline fatalities per airline, including accident, fatality, and incident numbers from 1985 to 2014. The other file includes accidents and fatalities data from 1946 to 2022. The data dictionary explains the variables and their meanings.

Methods:
Power Bi graph anaylizes 

Analysis:
Presents the analysis of the data, highlighting the significant difference in the number of fatalities between airline and car travel. Visualizations showcase trends over time, illustrating how safety measures have impacted both industries. The infograph compares airline safety to other modes of travel, emphasizing the lower risk of fatalities in air travel.

Conclusion:
Summarizes the key findings of the analysis, emphasizing the stark contrast in safety records between airlines and cars. It reinforces the conclusion that air travel is statistically safer than car travel in terms of fatalities.

Assumptions:
Acknowledges any assumptions made during the analysis, such as assuming data accuracy and consistency across the years. Assumptions regarding the reliability of reported incidents and fatalities are also mentioned.

Limitations:
Discusses limitations of the analysis, including potential data gaps, underreporting, and variations in reporting standards. Also considers limitations in the scope of the analysis, such as not accounting for non-fatal injuries.

Challenges:
Highlights challenges faced during data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, such as data quality issues, inconsistent categorization of incidents, and the need to harmonize data from different sources.

Future Uses/Additional Applications:
Suggests potential future applications of the analysis, such as comparing safety records in other transportation modes or exploring the impact of safety regulations on different industries.

Recommendations:
Provides recommendations based on the analysis, such as promoting awareness of airline safety statistics to mitigate public concerns, or advocating for similar safety measures in other industries.

Implementation Plan:
Outlines a plan for implementing the recommendations, which may include collaboration with relevant stakeholders, creating educational campaigns, or policy advocacy.

Ethical Assessment:
Addresses ethical considerations related to presenting safety statistics, ensuring transparency, and avoiding sensationalism. Discusses the responsibility of accurate data representation in maintaining public trust.

Overall, the Power BI dashboard effectively communicates the comparison between airline and car safety, utilizing data, visualizations, and voice-over narration to highlight the significant disparity in fatalities and emphasize the safety of air travel.
